Two stationary guns produce a glider every 60\ngens and an eastward MWSS every 120 gens; half of the gliders\ndelete the MWSSs while the other half escape.  But when a\nwestward MWSS reaches the guns, it deletes 2 consecutive gliders,\nallowing one eastward MWSS to escape and suppressing one output\nglider.  When an eastward MWSS hits a boat, it becomes a NEward\nglider which deletes one westward MWSS.  Thus, each westward\nMWSS that reaches the guns causes the deletion of a later\nwestward MWSS.  Specifically, if the westward MWSSs are\nnumbered starting at 3, then, for each integer  K >= 2,  MWSS\nnumber  floor(K phi)  causes the deletion of MWSS number\nfloor(K (phi+1)),  where  phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.  Also, a glider\nescapes from the bottom of the pattern about generation\n120 floor(K (phi+1)).
